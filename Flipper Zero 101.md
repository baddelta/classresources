Desktop app for Flipper Zero, great for screen mirroring to PC, small file transfer, firmware upgrades (official firmware only). 

## File Transfer
For larger file transfers is easier to write the files directly to the MicroSD card.

## AV Exceptions
It’s recommended to add the folder(S) where you will be downloading the Flipper files to your AV’s exception list to avoid files being removed or detected as malicious.  

## Use Cases
### MFA
### Universal Remote Control
If you keep losing the remote for everything at home just keep the Flipper in your pocket and control anything and everything with an IR receiver. 
### Bad USB
A Bad USB device can change system settings, open backdoors, retrieve data, initiate reverse shells, or do anything that can be achieved with physical access.
